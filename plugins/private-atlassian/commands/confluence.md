## /confluence Command

Perform a focused Confluence search or page fetch and return a compact digest.

### Steps

1. **Load settings**: Read `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/private-atlassian.local.md` to get `cloud_id`.
   If missing or empty, call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` once to retrieve it.
   Remind the user to populate the settings file if it wasn't found.

2. **Interpret the argument**:
   - If it looks like a numeric page ID (all digits): fetch that page with
     `getConfluencePage`.
   - If it looks like CQL (contains `~`, `AND`, `type =`, `space.key`): use it
     directly with `searchConfluenceUsingCql`.
   - Otherwise: treat as a natural-language query. Convert it to a CQL query.
     Examples:
     - "deployment runbooks" → `text ~ "deployment" AND type = page AND label = "runbook" ORDER BY lastModified DESC`
     - "auth docs in ENG space" → `space.key = "ENG" AND text ~ "authentication" AND type = page ORDER BY lastModified DESC`
     - "recently updated pages" → `type = page AND lastModified >= -7d ORDER BY lastModified DESC`

3. **Fetch results**:
   - For searches: limit to 10 results. Do not fetch page bodies during search.
   - For single page fetch: use `contentFormat: "markdown"`. Summarize; do not
     dump the full body.

4. **Output digest**:

   For a list of pages:
   ```
   Found N pages (CQL: <the query used>)

   ## Table of Contents
   - Overview
   - Prerequisites
   - Step-by-step guide
   - Troubleshooting

   ## Abstract
   <2–3 sentence summary of what the page covers>
   ```

5. **Offer to expand**: End with a brief offer:
   - For lists: "Want me to open any of these pages, or try a different search?"
   - For single pages: "Want me to read a specific section, or show the full content?"

### Rules

- Always use `contentFormat: "markdown"` when fetching pages — never `adf`.
- Never dump the full page body unprompted, even if it was fetched. Summarize first.
- If the page is very long (>200 lines of markdown), offer to read specific
  sections by heading rather than showing everything.
- If the user asks to "read" or "show" a page section, find the relevant heading
  in the markdown and output only that section.
- Limit search results to 10 per response. If more exist, say so and offer to
  narrow the query or browse by space.
- If the user's query is ambiguous (could be Jira or Confluence), default to
  Confluence but mention that `/jira` exists for ticket searches.
