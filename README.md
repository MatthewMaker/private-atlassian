# private-atlassian

A Claude Code plugin that mediates interaction with the Atlassian MCP server,
keeping Jira and Confluence responses focused and context-efficient.

## The Problem

The Atlassian MCP server returns verbose JSON. A single Confluence page fetch
can consume thousands of tokens; a JQL search dumping 20 full issue objects is
worse. Without mediation, every Atlassian interaction risks flooding the context
window with noise.

## What This Plugin Does

- **Digest-first output**: Summaries by default, full content only on request
- **Targeted queries**: JQL/CQL patterns that fetch only what's needed
- **cloudId caching**: Read once from a settings file, never redundantly fetched
- **Structured research**: An autonomous agent for multi-step Atlassian research
  that keeps raw intermediate results out of the main conversation

## Components

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `atlassian-mediation` | Skill | Teaches Claude the discipline of efficient Atlassian interaction |
| `/jira` | Command | Search Jira or look up an issue with digest output |
| `/confluence` | Command | Search Confluence or fetch a page with digest output |
| `atlassian-researcher` | Agent | Multi-step autonomous research across Jira + Confluence |

## Prerequisites

- Atlassian MCP server configured in Claude Code
  (`mcp__claude_ai_Atlassian__*` tools available)
- An Atlassian account with access to your workspace

## Setup

1. **Install the plugin** in Claude Code

2. **Create your settings file**:
   ```bash
   cp .claude/private-atlassian.local.md.example .claude/private-atlassian.local.md
   ```

3. **Find your cloud ID** — ask Claude:
   > "What is my Atlassian cloud ID?"

   Claude will call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` and display it.

4. **Edit `.claude/private-atlassian.local.md`**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   cloud_id: "your-cloud-id-here"
   site_url: "https://your-org.atlassian.net"
   ---
   ```

   This file is gitignored and will not be committed.

## Usage

### Commands

```
/jira PROJ-123
/jira my open bugs
/jira project = MYPROJ AND status = "In Progress"

/confluence deployment runbooks
/confluence auth docs in ENG space
/confluence 123456789
```

### Agent

Ask naturally:
> "Research the background on the auth refactor — check Jira and Confluence."

> "Give me a complete picture of PROJ-456: linked issues, history, related docs."

> "What Confluence pages exist about our deployment process?"

### Skill (automatic)

The `atlassian-mediation` skill activates automatically whenever you ask Claude
to look up Jira or Confluence content, enforcing context-efficient behavior
without any explicit invocation.

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `.claude/private-atlassian.local.md` (gitignored).
See `.claude/private-atlassian.local.md.example` for the template.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cloud_id` | Atlassian workspace UUID (required) |
| `site_url` | Your Atlassian site URL, e.g. `https://acme.atlassian.net` |
