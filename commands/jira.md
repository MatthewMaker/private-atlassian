## /jira Command

Perform a focused Jira lookup or search and return a compact digest.

### Steps

1. **Load settings**: Read `.claude/private-atlassian.local.md` to get `cloud_id`.
   If missing or empty, call `getAccessibleAtlassianResources` once to retrieve it.
   Remind the user to populate the settings file if it wasn't found.

2. **Interpret the argument**:
   - If it looks like an issue key (e.g. `PROJ-123`, `ABC-42`): fetch that single
     issue with `getJiraIssue`.
   - If it looks like JQL (contains `=`, `AND`, `OR`, `~`, `ORDER BY`): use it
     directly with `searchJiraIssuesUsingJql`.
   - Otherwise: treat as a natural-language query. Convert it to a JQL query.
     Examples:
     - "my open bugs" → `assignee = currentUser() AND issuetype = Bug AND status != Done ORDER BY updated DESC`
     - "recent PROJ issues" → `project = PROJ AND updated >= -7d ORDER BY updated DESC`
     - "login bug" → `text ~ "login bug" AND status != Done ORDER BY updated DESC`

3. **Fetch results**:
   - For searches: request at most 15 results. Do not fetch full issue bodies.
   - For single issue: fetch the issue. Produce a digest, not the raw JSON.

4. **Output digest**:

   For a list of issues:
   ```
   Found N issues (JQL: <the query used>)

   [PROJ-123] Fix login timeout — In Progress · Alice · High
     Labels: auth, bug  |  Updated: Jan 15
   [PROJ-121] Add rate limiting — To Do · Bob · Medium
     Updated: Jan 14
   ...
   ```

   For a single issue:
   ```
   [PROJ-123] Fix login timeout
   Status: In Progress  |  Assignee: Alice  |  Priority: High
   Reporter: Bob  |  Created: Jan 10  |  Updated: Jan 15
   Labels: auth, bug
   Type: Bug  |  Sprint: Sprint 12

   Summary:
   <2–3 sentence description from the issue body, not the full text>
   ```

5. **Offer to expand**: End with a brief offer:
   - For lists: "Want details on any of these, or a different query?"
   - For single issues: "Want the full description, comments, or linked issues?"

### Rules

- Never dump raw JSON or the full `description` field unprompted.
- If the user's query is ambiguous (could be Jira or Confluence), default to
  Jira but mention that `/confluence` exists for Confluence searches.
- If no results are found, suggest a relaxed query (fewer filters, broader text).
- Limit output to at most 15 issues per response. If there are more, say so and
  offer to paginate or narrow the query.
